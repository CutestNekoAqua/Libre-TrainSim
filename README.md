## About

This project was initially created by Jean28518. As the project attracted new contributers, we moved the repository into the [Libre Train Sim Organisation](https://github.com/Libre-TrainSim/). We want to create a modern, fully free train driving simulator running on Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android.
